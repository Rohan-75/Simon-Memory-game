# Simon-Memory-game
A classic web-based memory game where players must repeat a sequence of colors and sounds. The sequence gets progressively longer with each successful round, testing the player's memory.

# How to Play

Start the Game: Press any key on the keyboard to begin.

Watch the Sequence: The game will flash a color.

Repeat the Pattern: Click the button with the same color.

Level Up: If you are correct, the game will add another color to the sequence.


Game Over: If you click the wrong color, the game will end, and you can restart by pressing any key.

# Technologies Used
HTML5: Provides the basic structure of the game page.

CSS3: Used for styling the buttons, layout, and animations like the 'pressed' and 'game-over' effects.


JavaScript: Contains all the core game logic, including sequence generation, user input handling, and answer validation.


jQuery: Simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling.
